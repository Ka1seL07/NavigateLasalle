Measurement Guidelines:

*Do not use pixels instead:

vh (viewport height) - for images, icons related and padding/border or top and bottom sides.
vw (viewport height) - for containers and padding/border of left and right sides.
rem (root EM) - for fonts or text elements.

1. Pretty much backend and design only.
2. Only user side will follow up admin side.
3. Has few scripts but for operations that are easy enough (ex. time).
4. Also still no database for this one for now.
